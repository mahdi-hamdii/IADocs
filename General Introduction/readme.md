## What is LLM: Large Language Models
- `GPT`, `PaLM2` by Google, `Llama 2` by Meta and `Claude 2` by Anthropic are one of the most popular LLMs.
- One of the most well-known capabilities of LLM is text completion.
- LLM are Machine learning models based on a transformer architecture, using generative IA to perform natural language processing NLP tasks.
- **Machine Learning Model**: is an algorithm or mathematical formula that allows a computer to learn from data. Instead of being explicitly programmed to perform a task, it uses data to make predictions or decisions.
- **Transformer Architecture**: specific structure used in ML to process data sequences, like text. it is particularly powerful for understanding long-term dependencies in data.
- **Generative IA**: refers to AI models that can create new content. In the context of LLMs, this means generating text that didn't exist before.
- **Natural Language Processing NLP**: is a branch of IA focused on communication between computers and humans through natural language. This can include understanding, generating or translating text.
-> LLMs are AI models that use the transformer architecture to learn and generate text. They aren't specifically
- **Training ML model**: is like teaching a child how to solve a problem by showing them many examples.
- **Training LLM**: requires a lot of time, resources and energy. It also requires a large amount of high-quality data.
- Training GPT3 will require 570GB of data (300 billion words) and consumed 1287 gigawatt-hours (equivalent to the consumption of about a hundred American households per year). On top of the training cost, thereâ€™s the daily operational cost, amounting to approximately $700k per day.
## Text Understanding:
- The key to enabling LLM to understand text and provide quality response is `context window` and `attention mechanism`.
- **Attention Mechanism**: Allows the model to understand the relationships between words, sentences, and paragraphs and thus the deep meaning of a text.
- **Context Window**: The maximum number of words the model can use to both generate response and refer to for keeping a history and accessing new data.
## What are GPT and ChatGPT:
- **GPT**: `Generative Pre-Trained Transformers` is the LLM developped by OpenAI.
